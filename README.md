# React Video Trimmer App

This is a React application that allows you to trim a video file. It utilizes the `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` library to perform the video trimming process. The application provides a user interface where you can enter the URL of a .webm video asset, specify the start and end time for trimming, and preview the trimmed video. You can also download the trimmed video directly from the app.


## Setup 
Run the following: 
1. `npm i @ffmpeg/ffmpeg @ffmpeg/core`
2. `npm i react-scripts@latest`
3. `npm start`
